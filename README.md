# Sparkify-project-Udacity-Capstone

In this project, we build different models to predict user churn from a song streaming service dataset. Firstly, we performed Exploratory Data Analysis to understand the dataset. Then we performed feature engineering based on user activities. Then we fed the calculated features into the three models. Out of the three models we used, Random Forest classifier performed the best, and then the Gradient Boost Tree classifier gave a good F1 score.

We calculate the following features on which we build our models.

### The features we calculate are:

    1. Total number of thumbs up.
    2. Total number of thumbs down.
    3. Average number of songs per session.
    4. Number of add to playlist events.
    5. Number of add friends events.
    6. Total number of errors encountered.
    7. Total number of songs played.

### In this Project we used the following libraries:
    1.Numpy
    2.Matplotlib
    3.Pandas
    4.Seaborn
    5.PySpark
